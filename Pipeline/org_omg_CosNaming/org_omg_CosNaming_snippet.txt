Sample: 0 _BindingIteratorStub

@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use void destroy() from org.omg.CosNaming._BindingIteratorStub
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
The `void destroy()` method in `org.omg.CosNaming._BindingIteratorStub` is used to destroy the stub and free up any system resources associated with it.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import org.omg.CosNaming._BindingIteratorStub;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        _BindingIteratorStub stub = new _BindingIteratorStub();
        try {
            stub.destroy();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `_BindingIteratorStub` object and call the `destroy()` method on it. We catch any exceptions that may be thrown by the `destroy()` method and print the stack trace to the console.

Please note that the `destroy()` method is not part of the Java SDK and is likely a part of the OMG CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) API. The `_BindingIteratorStub` class is likely a part of the CORBA API and is used to manage the lifecycle of a stub object.
