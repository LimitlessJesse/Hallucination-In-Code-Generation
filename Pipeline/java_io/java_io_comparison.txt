@@ Response
Here is a list of useful methods from the BufferedInputStream class in Java:

1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array b. It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.

3. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. It returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.

4. `long skip(long n)`: This method skips and discards n bytes of data from the input stream.

5. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from the input stream without blocking.

Here is a list of useful methods with their return types and parameters for the `java.io.StringReader` package:

1. `int read()`: This method reads a single character. It returns the character read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.

2. `int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`: This method reads characters into a portion of an array. It returns the number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached.

3. `long skip(long n)`: This method skips characters. It returns the number of characters that were skipped.

4. `boolean ready()`: This method tells whether this stream is ready to be read.

5. `void close()`: This method closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it.

Here is a list of useful methods from the `java.io.StringWriter` package:

1. `StringWriter()`: This is the constructor of the `StringWriter` class. It initializes a new StringWriter that uses a default-sized output buffer.

2. `StringWriter(int initialSize)`: This is the constructor of the `StringWriter` class. It initializes a new StringWriter that uses an output buffer of the specified size.

3. `void write(int c)`: This method writes a single character.

4. `void write(char[] cbuf)`: This method writes an array of characters.

5. `void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`: This method writes a portion of an array of characters.

6. `void write(String str)`: This method writes a string.

7. `void write(String str, int off, int len)`: This method writes a portion of a string.

8. `StringWriter append(CharSequence csq)`: This method appends the specified character sequence to this writer.

9. `StringWriter append(CharSequence csq, int start, int end)`: This method appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this writer.

10. `StringWriter append(char c)`: This method appends the specified character to this writer.

11. `String toString()`: This method returns the current contents of the character sequence being written to the `StringWriter`.

12. `void flush()`: This method flushes the stream.

13. `void close()`: This method closes the stream, flushing it first.

14. `void write(int c)`: This method writes a single character.

15. `void write(char[] cbuf)`: This method writes an array of characters.

16. `void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`: This method writes a portion of an array of characters.

17. `void write(String str)`: This method writes a string.

18. `void write(String str, int off, int len)`: This method writes a portion of a string.

19. `StringWriter append(CharSequence csq)`: This method appends the specified character sequence to this writer.

20. `StringWriter append(CharSequence csq, int start, int end)`: This method appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this writer.

21. `StringWriter append(char c)`: This method appends the specified character to this writer.

22. `String toString()`: This method returns the current contents of the character sequence being written to the `StringWriter`.

23. `void flush()`: This method flushes the stream.

24. `void close()`: This method closes the stream, flushing it first.
