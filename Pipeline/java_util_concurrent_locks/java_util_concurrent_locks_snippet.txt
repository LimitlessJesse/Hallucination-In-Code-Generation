I want to learn how to use int getState() from java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

}

@@ Response
The `getState()` method in `java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` is used to get the current state of the synchronizer. This method is protected, meaning it can only be accessed by subclasses of `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer`.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractQueuedSynchronizer synchronizer = new AbstractQueuedSynchronizer() {
            @Override
            protected int tryAcquireShared(int arg) {
                return getState();
            }
        };

        int state = synchronizer.tryAcquireShared(1);
        System.out.println("Current state: " + state);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are creating a subclass of `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` and overriding the `tryAcquireShared` method to return the current state of the synchronizer. We then call `tryAcquireShared` with an argument of 1 and print the returned state.

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual usage of `getState()` method in `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` is more complex and depends on the specific use case.

@@ Response
The `compareAndSetState(int expect, int update)` method is part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` class. It is used to atomically compare the current value of the state variable with the expected value, and if they are equal, to set the state variable to the given updated value.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        boolean result = aqs.compareAndSetState(expect, update);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

```

In this code snippet, we create an anonymous class that extends `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` and overrides the `compareAndSetState(int expect, int update)` method. We then call this method with some expected and updated values, and print the result.

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual usage of `compareAndSetState(int expect, int update)` method would depend on the specific use case and requirements.

The `isHeldExclusively()` method is not a method of `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer`, but it is a method of `ReentrantLock`.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `isHeldExclusively()` method from `ReentrantLock`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Main {

}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `ReentrantLock` object, lock it, and then call the `isHeldExclusively()` method. The `isHeldExclusively()` method returns `true` if the current thread holds the lock exclusively, and `false` otherwise.

Please note that `isHeldExclusively()` is a protected method in `ReentrantLock`, so it can't be accessed directly from outside the class. Therefore, we need to use it inside a try-finally block to ensure that the lock is always unlocked, even if an exception is thrown.

        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `ReentrantLock` object. Then, we try to acquire the lock using the `tryLock()` method. If the lock is not currently held by another thread, the lock is acquired and the method returns `true`. If the lock is held by another thread, the method returns `false`.

If the lock is acquired, we perform some operations and then release the lock using the `unlock()` method. If the lock is not acquired, we print a message indicating that the lock is not acquired.

Please note that the `tryLock()` method is a non-blocking method, meaning it will not wait for the lock to become available. If the lock is not available, it will return immediately with `false`.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `void lock()` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        lock.lock();

        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a new `ReentrantLock` object. Then we call the `lock()` method on this object. This method will block the current thread indefinitely until it can acquire the lock.

After the critical section of code, we call the `unlock()` method on the same object. This will release the lock and allow other threads to acquire it.

The `finally` block is used to ensure that the lock is always unlocked, even if an exception is thrown. This is important because if a thread is blocked indefinitely waiting for a lock, it could cause a deadlock if another thread tries to acquire the same lock.

In this code, we create a `ReentrantLock` object and then call the `isLocked()` method. The `isLocked()` method returns `true` if the lock is held by any thread, and `false` otherwise.

When we first call `isLocked()`, it returns `false` because the lock is not held. Then, we call `lock()` to acquire the lock, and `isLocked()` returns `true`. Finally, we call `unlock()` to release the lock, and `isLocked()` returns `false`.

This is because the `isHeldByCurrentThread()` method returns `true` if the current thread holds the lock, and `false` otherwise. In the first print statement, the lock is not held by any thread, so the method returns `false`. In the second print statement, the lock is held by the current thread, so the method returns `true`.

The `Condition newCondition()` method is used to create a new condition that is associated with this lock. The condition is used to block the current thread until it is signalled or interrupted.

Here is an example of how to use it:

import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

            readLock.lock();
            condition.await(); // This will block the current thread
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {

        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();

    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` and then get a `ReadLock` from it. We then create a new `Condition` associated with this lock.

We then use the `await()` method of the `Condition` to block the current thread. If another thread calls `signal()` or `signalAll()` on the same `Condition`, the current thread will be unblocked.

Note that `await()` will also release the lock, so you need to re-acquire the lock before using the condition again.

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` and a `Condition` from its `WriteLock`. Then, we use the `lock()` method to acquire the write lock. After that, we call the `await()` method on the `Condition`, which will cause the current thread to wait until another thread calls the `signal()` or `signalAll()` method on the same `Condition`.

Please note that `await()` method will release the lock and wait for signal. After the signal is received, the lock is automatically reacquired and the `await()` method returns.

Also, `await()` method can be interrupted by another thread. In this case, `InterruptedException` is thrown and the lock is automatically released.

I want to learn how to use boolean isHeldByCurrentThread() from java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is a complete code snippet of the `isHeldByCurrentThread()` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
        ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock writeLock = lock.writeLock();

        // Check if the write lock is held by the current thread
        boolean isLockHeld = writeLock.isHeldByCurrentThread();
        System.out.println("Is write lock held by current thread? " + isLockHeld);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` and then get the `WriteLock` from it. We then call the `isHeldByCurrentThread()` method on the `WriteLock` to check if it is held by the current thread. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that this code will not work as expected if run in an environment where the current thread is not the thread that holds the lock. In such cases, the `isHeldByCurrentThread()` method will return `false`.

The `long tryOptimisticRead()` method of `StampedLock` class is used to try to acquire a read lock, optimistically. If the lock is not contended, it is immediately available and the method returns a stamp. If the lock is contended, the method returns -1L.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StampedLock lock = new StampedLock();
        long stamp = lock.tryOptimisticRead();
        if (stamp!= -1L) {
            // Perform read operation
            System.out.println("Read operation performed successfully");
            lock.validate(stamp);
        } else {
            // Lock is contended, perform alternative action
            System.out.println("Lock is contended, performing alternative action");
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `StampedLock` object. Then we try to acquire a read lock optimistically using the `tryOptimisticRead()` method. If the lock is not contended, we perform the read operation and then validate the stamp using the `validate()` method. If the lock is contended, we perform an alternative action.

The `long writeLock()` method of `StampedLock` is used to obtain a write lock. If the lock is not already held by another thread, the current thread acquires it and returns a stamp. If the lock is held by another thread, the current thread blocks until the lock is available, at which point it can acquire it and return a stamp.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock;

public class Main {
    private final StampedLock lock = new StampedLock();

    public void write() {
        long stamp = lock.writeLock();
        try {
            // Write operation here
        } finally {
            lock.unlockWrite(stamp);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main main = new Main();
        main.write();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `StampedLock` object. Then, in the `write()` method, we use the `writeLock()` method to obtain a write lock. We then perform the write operation within a try block, and finally, we unlock the write lock using the `unlockWrite()` method.

Please note that the actual write operation is not provided in this example. You should replace the comment with your actual write operation.
