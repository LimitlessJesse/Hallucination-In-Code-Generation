I want to learn how to use void destroy() from java.applet.Applet
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

The `destroy()` method is a part of the `Applet` class in Java. It is used to clean up resources that the applet has used.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `destroy()` method:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Applet applet = new Applet() {
            public void destroy() {
                // Clean up resources here
            }
        };
        applet.destroy();
    }
}
```

In the above code, we are creating an anonymous inner class of `Applet` and overriding the `destroy()` method. Inside the `destroy()` method, we can put the code to clean up resources that the applet has used.

Please note that the `destroy()` method is not typically called directly by the programmer. It is called by the Java Virtual Machine when the applet is being removed from the display.

The `void init()` method in Java Applet is used to initialize the applet. It is called automatically by the Java Virtual Machine when the applet is first created.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `void init()` method:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class MyApplet extends Applet {
    public void init() {
        // Initialization code
    }

    public void start() {
        // Start or resume execution of the applet
    }

    public void stop() {
        // Stop execution of the applet
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Prepare for a subsequent life-cycle
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        // Paint the applet
    }
}
```

In the above code, `MyApplet` is a subclass of `Applet`. The `init()` method is overridden to provide the initialization code for the applet.

Please note that the `init()` method is not a part of the `main()` method. It is a method in the `Applet` class that is used to initialize the applet. The `main()` method is a method in the `Main` class that is used to start the execution of the program.
