I want to learn how to use void destroy() from org.omg.CORBA.ORB
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

The `void destroy()` method in the `org.omg.CORBA.ORB` interface is used to destroy the ORB instance. It is important to note that once the ORB instance is destroyed, all the resources associated with it are also released.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `void destroy()` method:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.ORB;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);
        orb.destroy();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first initialize the ORB instance using the `ORB.init(args, null)` method. Then we call the `destroy()` method on the ORB instance to release all the resources associated with it.

Please note that you need to have the necessary CORBA libraries in your classpath to compile and run this code. Also, the `ORB.init(args, null)` method is a static method, so you don't need to create an instance of `ORB` to call this method.

The `resolve_initial_references` method is not part of the `org.omg.CORBA.ORB` interface. It is part of the `org.omg.CORBA.NamingContextExt` interface.

Here is a simple example of how you can use the `resolve_initial_references` method from `org.omg.CORBA.NamingContextExt`:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.ORB;
import org.omg.CORBA.ORBPackage.InvalidName;
import org.omg.CORBA.Object;
import org.omg.CORBA.ORBPackage.NameValuePair;
import org.omg.CORBA.NamingContextExt;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);
        NamingContextExt namingContext = (NamingContextExt) orb.resolve_initial_references("NameService");
        try {
            Object obj = namingContext.resolve_str("Hello");
            System.out.println(obj);
        } catch (InvalidName e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we are resolving the initial reference to the "NameService" and then resolving a string "Hello".

Please note that you need to have the necessary CORBA libraries in your classpath and you need to have the necessary permissions to access the CORBA service.

Also, the `resolve_initial_references` method is not part of the `org.omg.CORBA.ORB` interface. It is part of the `org.omg.CORBA.NamingContextExt` interface.

    }
}

@@ Response
The `shutdown(boolean wait_for_completion)` method in the `org.omg.CORBA.ORB` class is used to shut down the CORBA ORB. It takes a boolean parameter `wait_for_completion` which determines whether the ORB should wait for all outstanding requests to complete before shutting down.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.ORB;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);
        orb.shutdown(true);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first initialize the ORB using the `ORB.init(args, null)` method. Then we call the `shutdown(true)` method on the ORB instance, which shuts down the ORB and waits for all outstanding requests to complete.

Please note that you need to have the necessary CORBA libraries and dependencies in your classpath to be able to use the `org.omg.CORBA.ORB` class. Also, this code snippet assumes that you are running in a CORBA environment.
