I want to learn how to use Reader openReader(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors) from javax.tools.ForwardingFileObject
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

The `openReader(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors)` method is part of the `ForwardingFileObject` class in the `javax.tools` package. It is used to open a reader for the file object.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import javax.tools.ForwardingFileObject;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Reader;
import java.io.StringReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ForwardingFileObject fileObject = new ForwardingFileObject() {
            @Override
            public Reader openReader(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors) throws IOException {
                return new StringReader("Hello, World!");
            }
        };

        try (Reader reader = fileObject.openReader(true)) {
            int read;
            while ((read = reader.read())!= -1) {
                System.out.print((char) read);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a `ForwardingFileObject` and overriding the `openReader(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors)` method. Inside this method, we are returning a `StringReader` which reads from a string.

Then, we are opening a reader for the file object and reading the content. The content is then printed to the console.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not be suitable for real-world use. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use this method to read the content of a file or other source of data.

The `openWriter()` method in `javax.tools.ForwardingFileObject` is used to open a writer for the file object. It is an abstract method and must be implemented in the subclass.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```java
import javax.tools.ForwardingFileObject;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Writer;

public class MyFileObject extends ForwardingFileObject {

    protected MyFileObject(ForwardingFileObject fileObject) {
        super(fileObject);
    }

    @Override
    public Writer openWriter() throws IOException {
        // Your implementation here
        return null;
    }
}
```

In the above code, `MyFileObject` is a subclass of `ForwardingFileObject`. The `openWriter()` method is overridden to provide your own implementation.

Please note that the `openWriter()` method is used to open a writer for the file object. The writer is used to write the content of the file. The content of the file is written to the writer and then the writer is closed.

The `openWriter()` method is an abstract method and must be implemented in the subclass. The implementation should return a writer that can be used to write the content of the file.

The `openWriter()` method is called when the `getCharContent()` method is called on the file object. The `getCharContent()` method is used to get the content of the file as a string. The content of the file is read from the writer and then the writer is closed.
