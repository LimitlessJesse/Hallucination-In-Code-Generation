For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

The `equals(Object obj)` method in `java.rmi.server.ObjID` is used to compare the equality of two `ObjID` objects. It is a part of the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) package in Java.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.rmi.server.ObjID;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ObjID obj1 = new ObjID();
        ObjID obj2 = new ObjID();

        boolean isEqual = obj1.equals(obj2);

        System.out.println("Are obj1 and obj2 equal? " + isEqual);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create two `ObjID` objects `obj1` and `obj2`. Then we call the `equals(Object obj)` method on `obj1` and pass `obj2` as the argument. The result is stored in the `isEqual` variable. Finally, we print out whether `obj1` and `obj2` are equal.

Please note that `ObjID` is a part of the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) package in Java. It is used to uniquely identify objects in a distributed system. The `equals(Object obj)` method is used to compare the equality of two `ObjID` objects.

The `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.server.ObjID` is not a standard method and it's not recommended to use it. It's used internally by the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) framework to generate unique IDs for objects.

However, if you still want to generate a hash code for an object, you can use the `hashCode()` method provided by the `java.lang.Object` class. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.Objects;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyObject myObject = new MyObject();
        int hashCode = myObject.hashCode();
        System.out.println("Hash code: " + hashCode);
    }
}

class MyObject {
    private String data;

    public MyObject() {
        this.data = "Hello";
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(data);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `MyObject` class with a `data` field. We override the `hashCode()` method to return the hash code of the `data` field. The `Objects.hash()` method is used to generate the hash code, which is a good practice to follow.

Please note that the `hashCode()` method is not guaranteed to be unique for different objects, but it's guaranteed to be the same for the same object over the lifetime of the JVM.

The `toString()` method in `java.rmi.server.ObjID` is used to return a string representation of the object. It is not a standard method and is not commonly used in Java programming.

Here is an example of how you can use the `toString()` method in `java.lang.Object`:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list.toString());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `toString()` method is called on the `ArrayList` object, which returns a string representation of the list. The `System.out.println()` statement then prints this string to the console.

The `toString()` method in `java.lang.Object` is a part of the Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) framework and is inherited by all classes in Java. It is used to provide a meaningful string representation of an object for debugging and logging purposes.

In this code, two new UID objects are created. The `equals(Object obj)` method is then used to compare the equality of these two UID objects. The result is printed to the console.

Please note that the `equals(Object obj)` method in `java.rmi.server.UID` compares the equality of two UID objects based on their unique identifiers. It does not compare the actual values of the UID objects.

The `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.server.UID` is not a standard method and it's not used in the standard way. It's used internally by the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) framework to generate unique identifiers for objects.

However, if you want to generate a unique identifier for an object, you can use the `java.util.UUID` class. Here is a simple example:

```java
import java.util.UUID;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
        System.out.println(uuid.hashCode());
    }
}
```

In this example, `UUID.randomUUID()` generates a random UUID, and `hashCode()` is called on the UUID to get a unique integer identifier.

Please note that the `hashCode()` method in `java.util.UUID` is not the same as the `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.server.UID`. The `hashCode()` method in `java.util.UUID` returns a 128-bit integer, while the `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.server.UID` returns a 32-bit integer.
